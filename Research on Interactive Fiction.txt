STATISTICS:

Polar-correlated stats instead of only one. E.g.:
Sylish/Serious
Intimidating/Relaxed
Drunk/Sober
Liar/Trusthful

CHOICES:

Based on Skills and based on "why"
Makes differents posibilities, takes time deciding
%85 positives ends?

STORY:

Use 2nd person view

Necessities:
- Command prompt ("talk" to the game, tell it want we want to do)
- Locations to visit
- Game file(s) describing our world (persistent)
- Puzzles, items, characters, etc.

Room class:
- Needs an id, name, description
- List of connected rooms
- List of items in the room
- List of NPCs in the room
- Persistent rooms with json module:
	- Allows "serializing" our rooms
	- Hand-editable
	- Expandable via adding fields

Text Wrapping: textwrap
- Automagically handles our wrapping needs

Data Files: 
* sqlite3 module
	- Simple SQL database
	- Store the entire game in a single file
* tempfile module:
	- Make a temporary, working copy of the game
* shutil module
	- For copying the clean game file to a temp file
	- For creating our saves

More:
* curses module:
	- Status bar

#### MAKING A TEXT ADVENTURE PARSER
#### https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II3O1CJA-x8

Check:
"creating interactive fiction with Inform 7"
Hartnell "Creating adventure games on your computer"
"The Z-machine standars document"

the thing that makes a text adventure stand out or fall flat on its face
is the quality of the parser

Rooms/Objects have attributes: id, holder, name, description id, n, s, e, w , weight
	: portable, container, supporter, emitting light, being worn, openable

SENTENCE:
Verb / Direct Object / Preposition / Indirect Object => Subroutine (direct, default, or "dont understand")

TABLES:

Articles: A, AN, THE
[For removing whitespace from the input]
Prepositions: IN, ON, UNDER, OVER, AT, WITH
[Flags used to chop up the sentence] [left: direct object; right: indirect object]
Dictionary: OLD, RUSTY, IRON, SWORD. BOX, STRANGE
[List of all the words that the game understands]
Verbs: 0 GET, 0 TAKE, 0 PICK UP, 1 LOOK AT, 2 EXAMINE, 2 INSPECT, 3 X, 4 LOOK
[same ID, synonims]

- Mapt the words in the dictionary to the object table
- Jump tables (to map user input to subroutines)
- String tables (for names, descriptions, messages)

PARSING:

- Clean up input (uppercase, remove articles)
- Identify parts of speech (Ver, DO, DI)
- Verify the words entered are in the game´s dictionary
- Try to map the words to objects
- Map the user input into to a subroutine, if not execute the default subroutine for that verb

DESAMBIGUATION:
When searching through the tables, score each object and pick the one with the highest score
If two or more objects have the same score, prompt the user to be more specifics
If a word doesn´t map to an object, set its score to 0

#### HARVESTING INTERACTIVE FICTION

What techniques can be harvested:
* Poetry:
	Prose
	Comunicate world character story
	Encourage the player to fill in blanks for themselves
* Ambiguity
	Byproduct of the medium
	Imagination has to fill details - Interpretation, draw their own conclusions - Meaning
	Omite some of the details deliberately
	What to leave out o leave something unclear
	Not at worldbuilding level but at narrative one
* Complicity
	Feeling of ownership of the plot
	Actual choices, actually affect the narrative
