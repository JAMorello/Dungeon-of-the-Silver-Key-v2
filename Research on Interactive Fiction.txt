What techniques can be harvested:
* Poetry:
	Prose
	Comunicate world character story
	Encourage the player to fill in blanks for themselves
* Ambiguity
	Byproduct of the medium
	Imagination has to fill details - Interpretation, draw their own conclusions - Meaning
	Omite some of the details deliberately
	What to leave out o leave something unclear
	Not at worldbuilding level but at narrative one
* Complicity
	Feeling of ownership of the plot
	Actual choices, actually affect the narrative
